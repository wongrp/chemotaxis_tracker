added a counter in the current_frame_dict assignment for loop to combat
indices jumping once cells disappear.
Still have index jumping problems, will need to see if it's a plotting/image (opencv)
error or a calculation error.

Trying to fix alg script first.
Somehow the resulting dictionary is more or less in tracking order but:
1. cells disappearing causes later boxes to shift indices down one.
2. In addition, the box id's are not ordered as desired.(probably a problem
with the id stuff)

idea: for cells that jump out of iou range, maybe artificially enlarge
      boxes during calculation...

2:45 pm: printing all major steps and comparing between detection and tracking
         to find out what's going on with the index jumping

Met with Pedram. Updates to be made:
1. Fix index jumping issue
2. Change file format to tif from avi
3. Update readme file

Side updates:
1. Single cell trajectories
2. Cell shape / alignment based on box information

Problem spotted: end boxes are getting deleted whenever current box length is
less than previous box length. This information is getting lost when doing the
linear sum assignment.
